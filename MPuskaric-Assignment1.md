#**Is it fair use or infringement?**
The argument for the applicability of fair use is extremely important to understanding copyright and putting copyright rules into practice. However, since the points that define fair use are vague and can be applied differently in nearly every context, it can be extremely difficult to say with certainty if something falls under fair use or not. 

###**Gabe the dog - 1812 Overture**

----------
####**Determine the different source material(s) used**

As a reminder, the four factors which fair use is judged upon are:

 - the purpose and character of your use
 - the nature of the copyrighted work 
 - the amount and substantiality of the portion taken
 - the effect of the use upon the potential market.

deeper analysis of the two media clips
could be two sections? or one?
